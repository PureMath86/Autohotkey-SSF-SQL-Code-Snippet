# Autohotkey-SSF-SQL-Code-Snippet
Implementing SQL Prompt's SSF Code Snippet with AutoHotKey

One of the most popular uses of the SQL Prompt SQL Server Management Studio Plug-in from Red Gate is the ssf code snippet.
The way the code snippet works is you type ssf and the space bar and it will automatically type 'select * from' which is one of the most common things to write in SQL Server Management Studio.

It's pretty useful but if you only want that functionality it doesn't make much sense to pay the $369 per user they're charging for it as I write this.  http://www.red-gate.com/products/sql-development/sql-prompt/

You can get the same functionality for free using AutoHotKey.

To get this to work:

1. Install AutoHotkey.  http://www.autohotkey.com/
2. Run the SQL_Code_Snippet.ahk script in this Github project.
3. Type ssf and the space bar or tab and 'select * from' will be typed on your screen.

Thanks to https://github.com/AutoHotkey/AutoHotkey for writing this great piece of software.
